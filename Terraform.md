**Outputs:**

* Output values are like the return values of a Terraform modules.
* Terraform outputs are used for two things: either printing details about a resource/datasource/local/variable in the command line or exporting different details about these if we are using a module.

* * Outputs are written in *"outputs.tf"* file .
